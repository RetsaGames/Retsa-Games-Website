	<H2>Things i made in 2021</H2>

	<H3> PROCEDURAL EXPERIMENTS</H3>
	<P>Began to experiment with procedural generation, maybe to make a game out of this, not sure. </P>
	<P>Just the idea of an algorithm generating an infinite virtual world is fascinating to me, 
	and i love the idea of making a piece of software that feels alive and independent of the user's input.
	<P>Had been active in the procedural generation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/">community</a> on Reddit, there is a lot of interesting gamedev stuff out there.</P>

	<H3> METAL VOMIT</H3>
	<P>
	Made a mecha themed runner for the Blackthornprod Game Jam #3 with the theme "less is more".
	The way i implemented the theme is by being minimalist in the mechanics and aesthetics: The game is played with just one button and 
	all the graphics are made in a grayscale color scheme.
	</P>
	<P>
	Metal Vomit was also my first "3D game" with all the game models and textures made by me, a fun stepping out of my confort-zone, 
	as i never did 3d modeling before.

	<H3> PATHETIC MEATSACK</H3>
	<P>
	Made a 2D Arcade Boss Rush game for the Screamortality game jam.
	</P>
	<P>
	Take control of a modified human being that now is just reduced to an ugly blob of meat with a gun. 
	Fight and endless stream of pain-inducing machines or die like a pathetic meatsack. 
	</P>
	<P>
	For the graphicals i experimented with using real photos taken from free stockphotos sites, using a cut-out animation style. 
	Have to repeat these techniques for a future game, looks really cool and is surprisingly easy to make.

	<H3> HOMUNCULUS SURGEON</H3>
	<P>Entered GMTK Game Jam 2021, the jam's theme was "Joined Together"</P>
	<P>Your humanoid creations are all messed up. Use a scalpel to separate as many siamese twin homunculus as you can in the given time.  </P>
	<P>For this jam i tried to make something completely different from my usual arcadey shoot-em-ups, going for a goofy "surgeon" simulator. </P>

	<H3> ISAIA 1314</H3>
	<P>Joined the RNDGAME JAM II, a jam where the theme is given by a random idea generator.</P>
	<P>
	The theme i got was "Beasts of treason", so i made a shoot em' up where the main character is a renegade angel a.k.a a demon, 
	fighting his friends turned foes.
	</P>
	<P>This jam started around the time i was was learning and experimenting with Pico8, a "fantasy console" that emulates the restriction of 
	80s computers and consoles. Scary as it sounds, i think the best way learn how to use a game engine is making a game in a short amount of time, 
	so i did that. To my surprise, the game got a positive reception and ended looking like a lost NES shoot em' up.

	<H3> GATORO</H3>
	<P>
	Joined the VimJam 2, with the themes "Boss" and "on the edge". Still obsessed with pico8, 
	and very pleased with the end result of Isaia1314, i decided to make another arcadey pico8 shooter.
	</P>
	<P>
	Take control of Gatoro, a cat that just saw a demonic entity appear outside his apartment.
	Fight this strange visitor on the edge of your building roof.
	</P>
	<P>
	Another aim of this proyect was implementing in Pico8 a very common aspect of my games: having a cutscene. 
	I think i like animating as much as coding mechanics, and making animation from scratch is double the fun.
