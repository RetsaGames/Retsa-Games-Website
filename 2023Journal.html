	<H1>2023 - development of Ultratoro</H1>
	<hr>
	<P>
		Until this year, I had never developed a game as "Retsa Games" with the intention of selling it; 
		all my previous creations were contract work, small game jams entries or simple experiments made for their own sake. 
		While I had worked as a game developer for six years, 
		I really wanted to make something I designed myself, for myself. 
		Releasing a game on a platform like Steam seemed like the logical next step.
	</P>

	<!--
	<P>
		As a solo developer, you have to wear many hats: programmer, designer and get the word out. 
		I'm really proud of my decision to dedicate a year of full-time development on a dream project, 
		but it wasn't the most sensible move on my part, 
		and it's probably something I won't attempt again under the same conditions.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		The timing was right: I had recently quit a full-time job I was unhappy with, 
		also had savings and a side gig as a teacher. 
		I planned for development to take no longer than a year, reasoning that at worst, 
		it would be a valuable learning experience.
	</P>
	-->
	<P>
		I also had a prototype for what I wanted to do. 
		Last year, I made a weird driving game on donut-shaped tracks called Ultratoro. 
		It was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/black-and-white-jam-8">Black and White Jam #8</a> in twelve days and received great feedback online. 
		When I showcased the game at Argentina's largest gaming expo, the reception was good. 
		Some gamedev friends urged me to expand it into a full release instead of leaving it as a free web game. 
		I also ported the game to Android (an awful experience, Google Play sucks). 
		I had the confidence that the Ultratoro prototype was something special to use as a stepping stone.
	</P>

	<p>
		So i started making the sequel: "Ultratoro 2", which was not the smartest decision as it was a sequel to a game no one knows.
		I dropped the 2 much latter on, but you can still see it listed on some parts of Steam as Ultratoro 2.
	</p>
	<p>
		As soon as the development started i shared gameplay on social media and got some coverage from argentinian gaming sites
		like <a href="https://www.extragamers.com.ar/">Extragamers</a> &
		<a href="https://nogamingnews.com">No gaming news</a>, which lessened the fear of releasing 
		something that goes completely unnoticed. I also made a lot of new friends.
	</p>
	<p>
		I had a playable alpha in about a month and started showcasing Ultratoro at gaming events, 
		which generated tons of feedback. 
		Every aspect of the game's design was shaped by watching people play and listening to their opinions. A
		s a developer, you develop blind spots for the parts of your design that don't work, so community input is essential. 
		In some ways, games design themselves; it's important not to get too attached to specific ideas that might not work and instead go with the flow.
	</p>

	<p>
		At first, the process of making levels was slow. 
		The weird premise of tracks being giant, moving toruses wasn't well-suited to the standard Unity scene editor. 
		Plus, my early levels felt empty and boring compared to what the game could support. 
		This was a great excuse to build something I'd always wanted: my own level editor. 
		The only thing more fun than making games is developing the tools to make them.
	</p>
	<p>
		I created a track builder integrated directly into the game. It sped up development and resulted in better levels. 
		Players can upload and download tracks on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=2274250">Steam's workshop</a>. 
		I also used the tool myself to create all the official levels.
	</p>
	<p>
		Beyond coding, I wanted to practice my animation and writing skills. 
		I added cutscenes between races that tell the story of a hacker infiltrating the servers of an evil, 
		cult-like corporation called Deusoft. 
		In the Ultratoro universe, users don't surf the internet on computers—they get inside cars and drive through cyberspace. 
		The network's nodes are giant donut-shaped tracks, and data manifests as obstacles to avoid. 
		"Anti-intruder" software appears as giant skeletal monsters. To create the human characters for animations, 
		I drew over photos of myself acting out the sequences, while the monsters are based on animal and human skeletons.
