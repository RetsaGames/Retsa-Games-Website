		<H1>Pathetic Meatsack</H1>
		
		<p>We destroyed the planet, now the machines are looking for revenge.</p>
		<p>In this 2D Arcade Boss Rush game, you take control of a modified human being that now is just reduced to an ugly blob of meat with a gun. </p>
		<p>Fight and endless stream of pain-inducing machines or die like a pathetic meatsack.</p>
		<p>Used a bunch of images from freeimages.com and pixabay.com as the sources for the graphics.</p>
		<p>Made for the Screamortality game jam, the optional themes were "infinity" and "threshold", 
			the game implements the infinity theme with the endless gameplay and the theme of an cybernetic hell where the human race in tortured for eternity.</p>
